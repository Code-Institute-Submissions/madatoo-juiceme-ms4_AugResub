### Features
#### Global

This website will be very simple and intuitive, to give my audience a great user experience.

That can be achieved by having:
1. A home button (logo placed on the top left corner) in navigation.
2. Responsive menu placed on the right side of the page.
3. Visible and intuitive navigation bar during the browser the whole page.
4. A footer stuck at the bottom of each page with Privacy Policy, Terms of Use and Copyright information placed on the left side of the page and social media icons, on the right-hand side, to follow shop on Instagram, Facebook and You Toube. Those links will open in separate pages.
I will begin by creating the mobile first design, because currently, most people look at websites on their smartphones before they check them online on bigger devices, such as tablets or laptops. (and that’s are our customers behaviours). 
Those features will apply to all of the pages on my website.
#### Home page
The home page is going to include all of the features listed above. It will also have a jumbotron which will hover, and move a little to the front, to give my audience a fun experience when they will visit this page.
#### Shop page 
#### Login page
